   <h1>W01	Getting Started</h1>
       <p>Java is one of the top five programming languages, and is used for websites, embedded controllers, and Android app development. </p>
       <p><b>Object-oriented programming (OOP)</b> is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Object-oriented programming is more than just classes and objects; it's a whole programming paradigm based around objects (data structures) that contain data fields and methods. It is essential to understand this; using classes to organize a bunch of unrelated methods together is not object orientation.</p>
       <p><b>Classes</b> – the definitions for the data format and available procedures for a given type or class of object; may also contain data and procedures (known as class methods) themselves, i.e. classes contain the data members and member functions. Or a category of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.</p>
       <p>Classes have 2 things. Attributes and methods. Attributes - describe the class. Methods describe interacting with the class</p>
       <p>In class-based languages the classes are defined beforehand and the objects are instantiated based on the classes. If two objects apple and orange are instantiated from the class Fruit, they are inherently fruits and it is guaranteed that you may handle them in the same way; e.g. a programmer can expect the existence of the same attributes such as color or sugar content or is ripe. </p>
       <p><b>Objects</b> – instances of classes. Or a self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.</p>
       <p><b> Procedures</b> in object-oriented programming are known as methods; </p>
       <p><b>Variables</b></p>
       <p><b>Class variables</b> – belong to the class as a whole; there is only one copy of each one</p>
   <h1>W02	Data Types, Operators, Strings and Program I/O</h1>
       <p>Data types:</p>
       <p>int-> integer 1, 2, 3</p>
       <p>double -> decimal 34.5, 32.1</p>
       <p>String -> "a1a2" or "Hello World"</p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>A string is a list of characters</li>
                <li>Strings are ummutable. Cannot be changed after it exists</li>
                <li>A single character is called a char</li>
                <li>Ex: "abc", "P1,P2", "Hi There"</li>
                <li>In Java 8, strings are made up of chars in a single char array, but here in Java 9 they are made up of bytes in a byte array. And so here we see private final bytes.</li>
            </ul>
